\title{Main function for detecting and evaluating significance of DMRs.}
\usage{
vmrseq(
  gr,
  cutoff = 0.1,
  minNumRegion = 5,
  minNumLong = 20,
  transitProbs = NULL,
  smooth = TRUE,
  bpSpan = 1000,

  maxGapSmooth = 2500,
  maxGap = 1000,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{GRanges object containing the chromosome position and methylation
values. Should contain two metadata columns: `meth` and `total`, indicating
number of methylated cells and total number of cells.}

\item{cutoff}{positive scalar value that represents the cutoff value of
variance that is used to discover candidate regions. Default value is 0.10.}

\item{minNumRegion}{positive integer that represents the minimum number of
CpGs to consider for an VMR as well as a candidate region. Default value is
5. Minimum value is 3.}

\item{minNumLong}{positive integer that represents the minimum number of
CpGs to consider for a *long* candidate region. For fast computation use.
Default is 20. Long regions will be performed a more thorough search of
optimized prevalence value. Minimum value is the `minNumRegion`.}

\item{BPPARAM}{a \code{BiocParallelParam} object to specify the parallel
backend. The default option is \code{BiocParallel::bpparam()} which will
automatically creates a cluster appropriate for the operating system.}
}
\value{
a \code{GRanges} object that contains the results of the inference.
}
\description{
Performs a two-step approach that (1) detects candidate regions,
and (2) detect variably methylated region(s) inside each candidate region
using a hidden Markov model.
