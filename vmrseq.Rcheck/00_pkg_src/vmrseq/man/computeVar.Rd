\title{Compute the smoothed variance}
\usage{
computeVar(gr, M, meanMeth, bpWindow, sparseNAdrop, parallel)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{same as in \code{vmrseq.smooth}}

\item{M}{numeric matrix of binary single-cell methylation status. Row number
should be equal to the number of CpG sites and column number should be equal
to the number of cells.}

\item{meanMeth}{numeric vector of across-cell mean methylation. Length should
be equal to the number of CpG sites.}

\item{bpWindow}{same as in \code{vmrseq.smooth}}

\item{sparseNAdrop}{same as in \code{vmrseq.smooth}}

\item{parallel}{logical value that indicates whether function should be
run in parallel}
}
