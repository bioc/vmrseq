# vmrseq
Detecting single-cell methylation heterogeneity at site-level resolution.

## Background
The R package `vmrseq` is a novel computational tool developed for pinpointing variably methylated regions (VMRs) in scBS-seq data. It thoroughly searches for VMRs with a genome-wide scan in a flexible manner that does not require prior knowledge of their sizes or location contexts. Based on simulations and case studies, `vmrseq` has shown considerable improvements in detection accuracy as well as cell-type clustering performance. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of RAMEN from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("korthauer-lab/vmrseq")
```
